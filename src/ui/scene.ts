/*
 * Reference-counted "the scene is covered" holds. The phone-landscape rotate
 * card and the mobile menu sheet each stop the WebGL frame while they cover
 * it: the engine skips rendering (engine.paused), the last frame stays behind
 * the frosted glass, perfectly still, and an unseen scene never burns battery.
 *
 * Holds may be taken before the engine exists (the rotate card mounts with
 * the loader, on the very first frame); they apply once bindScene() runs.
